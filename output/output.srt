1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,240
He

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let me down easily

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
You're too light, you're too light

5
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,100
Don't you pray, don't you pray

6
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,899
You're seeking for my embrace

7
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,899
Wanting my dust begging me to stay

8
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:43,700
Every night and day

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,700
Call my name, shout it till you break

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,700
You took my heart

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,200
Held it and ran to the park

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,700
Made me a prisoner

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,700
Got me going round the

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,700
Feel it that you found

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,700
Fuddled me again

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,700
Not until I spent

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,700
Taking my own land

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,700
God's happy me

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,700
Oh, get over my doubt

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,700
Don't I get it without

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,700
For a year right now

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,700
Look at my way, look at my way

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,700
Look at my way, look at my way

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,700
Look at my way, look at my way

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,700
Look at my way, look at my way

26
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,700
Look at my way, look at my way

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,700
I want to know the cure

28
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,700
For at that time you made me endure

29
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,700
All the words you say

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,700
I'll keep your people at the head

31
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,700
I work in this town

32
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,700
Ready my love, one dance

33
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Taking me leaping

34
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,700
Getting far away from your cheetah

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,700
Sicking for my embrace

36
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,700
Wanting my dust begging me to stay

37
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
Every night and day

38
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,700
Callin' mine up, shut it till you break

39
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,700
You took my heart

40
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Held it and ran to the park

41
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,699
Made me a prisoner

42
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,699
Got me going round the

43
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,699
Feel it that you found

44
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,699
Fuddled me again

45
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:19,699
Not until I spent

46
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:21,699
Taking my own land

47
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,699
God's happy me

48
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:26,699
Oh, get over my doubt

49
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:28,699
Thought I can live without

50
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:32,699
For I get right now

51
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,699
Look at my way, look at my way

52
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,699
Look at my way, look at my way

53
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,699
Look at my way, look at my way

54
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:50,699
Look at my way, look at my way

55
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:52,699
I want to know the cure

56
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:55,699
For at that time you made me endure

57
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,699
No need to waste that

58
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,699
Take it back and lay

59
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,699
Go something new

60
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,699
Go something new

61
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,699
Get over my doubt

62
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:07,699
Thought I can live without

63
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,699
For I get right now

64
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:31,699
I'm telling you I'll kill for you

65
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:33,699
Like a fool, we know who

00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:36,699
Never was a dog in the face

67
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,699
You'll pull ever make me ill

68
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:40,699
We knew that I could fall in

69
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:43,699
Feel, cry, feel, make you proud

Then I'd be able to live

Tell you I'll kill for you

You'll pull ever make me ill

77
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,699
